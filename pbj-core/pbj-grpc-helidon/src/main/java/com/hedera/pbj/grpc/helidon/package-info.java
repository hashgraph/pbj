/**
 * An implementation of gRPC for the Helidon webserver based on PBJ.
 *
 * <p>The main entrypoint for this module, when handling a request, is the {@link
 * com.hedera.pbj.grpc.helidon.PbjProtocolSelector} class. A single instance of this class is
 * created by the {@link com.hedera.pbj.grpc.helidon.PbjProtocolProvider}, which is registered with
 * Helidon via the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} mechanism. A new selector will be created when
 * needed -- typically when config changes. Generally, it is safe to think of this class as being
 * long-lived.
 *
 * <p>The selector is then the initial entrypoint for all gRPC requests. It performs some basic
 * sanity checks on the request (was the method POST, does the route match the expected gRPC route,
 * etc.) and then creates a new instance of {@link com.hedera.pbj.grpc.helidon.PbjProtocolHandler}
 * to handle the request. Almost all the real work in handling the request is done by the protocol
 * handler.
 *
 * <p>Config is currently not used.
