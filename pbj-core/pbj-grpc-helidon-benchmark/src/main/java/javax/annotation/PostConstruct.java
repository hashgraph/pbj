/**
 * The <code>PostConstruct</code> annotation is used on a method that
 * needs to be executed after dependency injection is done to perform
 * any initialization. This  method must be invoked before the class
 * is put into service. This annotation must be supported on all classes
 * that support dependency injection. The method annotated with
 * <code>PostConstruct</code> must be invoked even if the class does
 * not request any resources to be injected. Only one
 * method in a given class can be annotated with this annotation.
 * The method on which the <code>PostConstruct</code> annotation is
 * applied must fulfill all of the following criteria:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The method must not have any parameters except in the case of
 * interceptors in which case it takes an <code>InvocationContext</code>
 * object as defined by the Interceptors specification.</li>
 * <li>The method defined on an interceptor class or superclass of an
 * interceptor class must have one of the following signatures:
 * <p>
 * void &#060;METHOD&#062;(InvocationContext)
 * <p>
 * Object &#060;METHOD&#062;(InvocationContext) throws Exception
 * <p>
 * <i>Note: A PostConstruct interceptor method must not throw application
 * exceptions, but it may be declared to throw checked exceptions including
 * the java.lang.Exception if the same interceptor method interposes on
 * business or timeout methods in addition to lifecycle events. If a
 * PostConstruct interceptor method returns a value, it is ignored by
 * the container.</i>
 * </li>
 * <li>The method defined on a non-interceptor class must have the
 * following signature:
 * <p>
 * void &#060;METHOD&#062;()
 * </li>
 * <li>The method on which the <code>PostConstruct</code> annotation
 * is applied may be public, protected, package private or private.</li>
 * <li>The method must not be static except for the application client.</li>
 * <li>The method should not be final.</li>
 * <li>If the method throws an unchecked exception the class must not be put into
 * service except in the case where the exception is handled by an
 * interceptor.</li></ul>
