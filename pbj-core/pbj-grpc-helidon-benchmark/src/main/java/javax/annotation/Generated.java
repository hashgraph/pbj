/**
 * The <code>Generated</code> annotation is used to mark source code
 * that has been generated.
 * It can also be used to differentiate user written code from generated code
 * in a single file.
 * <p>The <code>value</code> element must have the name of the
 * code generator. The recommended convention is to use the fully qualified
 * name of the code generator in the value field,
 * for example <code>com.company.package.classname</code>.</p>
 * <p>The <code>date</code> element is used to indicate the date the
 * source was generated.
 * The <code>date</code> element must follow the ISO 8601 standard.
 * For example, the <code>date</code> element could have the
 * value <code>2001-07-04T12:08:56.235-0700</code>,
 * which represents 2001-07-04 12:08:56 local time in the U.S. Pacific
 * time zone.</p>
 * <p>The <code>comment</code> element is a place holder for any comments
 * that the code generator may want to include in the generated code.</p>
